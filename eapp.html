		<div class="overview eapp">
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>EAPP is a B2B mobile app used by car dealerships. When I receive this product, we have a demo version of it. Less than 20 car dealerships were using it and testing it. My task is to redesign this product and make it a product that is valuable for our users. In this way, we can expand our market and sell this EAPP to more car dealerships. </p>
			<br>
			<p>But what is a “better” EAPP? I need to first find out what EAPP does and what our product goal is. Therefore, I tried to find a clue by analyzing the initial APP and conduction interviews with important stakeholders. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Key Problems: 1.Information structure is not correct regarding the defined product goal. 2.There are gaps between the real-world user flow and the app user flow. 2.It is hard to search for information on the app</p>

			<h2>Impact</h2>
			<p>The user has grown from 20 dealerships to about 3000.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We earn $150,000 more from this app, and it was one-quarter of our departments’ revenue in the year 2020. I was really proud of that.</p>
			<br>
			<p>EAPP impacted the behaviors of General Motors car dealers. Many of them are now hiring new employees for customer connection using the EAPP. It has a positive impact on GM’s brand image.</p>
