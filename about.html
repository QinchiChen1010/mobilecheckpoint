		<p>Hi, my name is Eva (Qinchi) Chen. I'm a curious multi-disciplinary UX designer with  2 years of working experience in digital products. I led an experimental membership system design, a voice assistance design, a data visualization product design, and multiple B2B products designs.</p>

		<p>I'm particularly skilled in identifying ambiguous product problems by conducting user research and experienced with leading creative workshops for problem-solving. </p>

		<p>I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree at the University of Michigan. I'm studying Information Science - UX Research and Design. My graduation time is Dec 2022. </p>

		<p>I'm currently looking for a full-time opportunity in the Great Seattle Area. Please download my resume or connect with me on my LinkedIn.</p>
